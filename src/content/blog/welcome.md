## Introduction

I’m Bastien, a 23-year-old software engineer obsessed with discovering, creating and learning. This is my personal space, 
that I will use to share discoveries, thoughts, ideas and more. I am based in Paris and trying to innovate for a good future, one day
after the other.

## Why 

In 2025, no one has time for nothing anymore, this is an attempt to put my mind on text, to take the time to share some of my insights 
and ideas. This is a process where I want to take the time to do that for me in order to figure out where I'm at in life and what
I want. Things are moving so fast that it's hard to take a breath and ask yourself if you're on the right path. I believe writing
these articles can help me.

## Let's connect

Thanks for coming by, if you want to connect it is a pleasure, wether if it because you want to talk or to discuss a project I would
be glad to have a chat, you can reach me on my socials on the top right corner of the screen.
