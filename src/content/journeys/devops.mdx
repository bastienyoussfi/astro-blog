## Why DevOps?

In today's fast-paced tech world, DevOps has become essential. I'm embarking on this journey to:

- **Bridge the gap** between development and operations
- **Automate everything** - from deployments to infrastructure
- **Scale efficiently** - learn cloud-native practices
- **Build reliability** - monitoring, logging, and observability

## The Roadmap

Following [roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops), I'll be covering:

1. **Operating Systems & Linux** - The foundation
2. **Networking & Security** - Understanding how systems communicate
3. **Version Control** - Git mastery
4. **Containers** - Docker & containerization
5. **Orchestration** - Kubernetes
6. **CI/CD** - Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
7. **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform, Ansible
8. **Cloud Platforms** - AWS, GCP, or Azure
9. **Monitoring** - Prometheus, Grafana, ELK
10. **And more...**

## Learning Approach

- **Learn in Public** - Document everything
- **Build Projects** - Practical hands-on experience
- **Daily Practice** - Consistency over intensity
- **Community** - Engage with DevOps communities

Let's do this!
