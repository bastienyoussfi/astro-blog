## Why DevOps?

In today's fast-paced tech world, DevOps has become essential. I'm embarking on this journey to **bridge the gap** between development and operations, I am tired of not understanding fully how systems work and relying on grey areas to function.

## Learning Approach

I'll be doing **Learn in Public**,  I want to document everything so it keeps me accountable for actually doing it and understand what I am learning. My goal is to **build projects** to get practical hands-on experience. I want to do **daily practice**, I believe in consistency over intensity. 

Lastly, I am here to meet people and engage with the tech community, so do not hesitate to come and talk with me :)
