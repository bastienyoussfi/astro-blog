## Why Machine Learning?

AI is transforming every industry. I want to understand how it works and build intelligent systems. This journey will take me from ML fundamentals to advanced deep learning.

## The Roadmap

Following [roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist), I'll cover:

1. **Python Fundamentals** - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
2. **Statistics & Math** - Linear algebra, probability, calculus
3. **Classical ML** - Regression, classification, clustering
4. **Deep Learning** - Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs
5. **NLP** - Text processing and language models
6. **Computer Vision** - Image recognition and processing
7. **ML Operations** - Model deployment and monitoring
8. **Advanced Topics** - Transformers, reinforcement learning

## Learning Approach

- **Theory + Practice** - Understand the math, then code it
- **Kaggle Competitions** - Real datasets, real challenges
- **Paper Reading** - Stay current with research
- **Build Projects** - End-to-end ML applications

Let's explore the world of AI!
