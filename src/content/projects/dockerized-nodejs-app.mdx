## Project Overview

This project containerizes a simple Express.js web application using Docker. It's my first real dive into containers, and it taught me the fundamentals of Docker and why it's such a game-changer for development and deployment.

## The Problem

Traditional deployment involves:

- "It works on my machine" syndrome
- Complex dependency management
- Environment inconsistencies between dev and production
- Difficult to scale and replicate

Docker solves all of these by packaging the application with its dependencies into a portable container.

## What I Built

A simple Express.js API with:

- REST endpoints for a TODO application
- Environment-based configuration
- Dockerized with multi-stage builds
- docker-compose for local development
- nginx as a reverse proxy

## Project Structure

```
dockerized-nodejs-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ .dockerignore
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nginx.conf
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
    â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## The Dockerfile

I learned about multi-stage builds to optimize image size:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY src/ ./src/

# Non-root user for security
USER node

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

## Docker Compose Setup

For local development with nginx:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    build: .
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3000
    networks:
      - app-network

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    depends_on:
      - app
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

## Key Commands

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-nodejs-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nodejs-app

# Use docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Stop everything
docker-compose down
```

## What I Learned

### 1. Images vs Containers

- **Images**: Read-only templates (the blueprint)
- **Containers**: Running instances of images (the house built from the blueprint)

### 2. Layer Caching

Docker caches each layer in the Dockerfile. Ordering matters:

- Copy `package.json` first
- Install dependencies
- Then copy source code

This way, dependency installation is cached if `package.json` hasn't changed.

### 3. `.dockerignore`

Just like `.gitignore`, but for Docker:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.env
.git
.gitignore
README.md
```

### 4. Container Networking

Containers can communicate by service name in docker-compose. The app connects to `http://redis:6379` rather than `localhost:6379`.

## Challenges Faced

### Permission Issues

Files created inside the container were owned by root. Solution: Use the `node` user in the Dockerfile.

### Debugging

Can't just SSH into a container. Learned to:

```bash
docker exec -it container_name sh
docker logs container_name
```

### Image Size

Initial image was 800MB. After multi-stage build and alpine base: **150MB**.

## Performance

- **Build time**: ~30 seconds (with cache)
- **Image size**: 150MB
- **Container startup**: &lt;1 second
- **Memory usage**: ~50MB

## Next Steps

Future improvements include:

1. **Health checks** in the Dockerfile
2. **Volume mounts** for logs
3. **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
4. **Kubernetes deployment** (future project)
5. **Monitoring** with Prometheus

## Conclusion

This project was my introduction to Docker, and I'm amazed by how powerful it is. Containers make deployment predictable, scalable, and portable.

The learning curve wasn't too steep, but understanding the nuances (layers, networking, security) takes practice.

**Next up**: Kubernetes! Time to orchestrate these containers at scale. ðŸš€
