## Everything is a File

One of the core concepts in Linux is that **everything is a file**. Whether it's an actual file, a directory, a device, or even a process‚Äîit's all represented in the file system.

## The File System Hierarchy

Linux follows a standardized directory structure. Let's explore the most important ones:

### `/` - The Root

The root directory is the top of the file system hierarchy. Everything branches from here.

### `/home` - User Directories

Each user gets their own directory under `/home`. For example, `/home/bastien` is my personal space.

### `/etc` - Configuration Files

System-wide configuration files live here. Want to change how SSH works? Look in `/etc/ssh/`.

### `/var` - Variable Data

Logs, databases, and other files that change frequently are stored in `/var`. Check `/var/log/` for system logs.

### `/usr` - User Programs

Most user programs and utilities are installed here. Think of it as "Unix System Resources."

### `/bin` and `/sbin`

Essential system binaries and system administration binaries, respectively.

### `/tmp` - Temporary Files

Temporary files that are typically cleared on reboot.

## Essential Navigation Commands

Let's master the basics:

### `pwd` - Print Working Directory

```bash
pwd
# Output: /home/bastien
```

Shows your current location in the file system.

### `ls` - List Directory Contents

```bash
ls          # Basic listing
ls -la      # Detailed listing with hidden files
ls -lh      # Human-readable file sizes
```

### `cd` - Change Directory

```bash
cd /var/log       # Absolute path
cd ../            # Go up one directory
cd ~              # Go to home directory
cd -              # Go to previous directory
```

### `tree` - Visual Directory Structure

```bash
tree -L 2         # Show 2 levels deep
```

## File Permissions

Understanding permissions is crucial in Linux:

```bash
ls -l myfile.txt
# -rw-r--r-- 1 bastien bastien 1024 Oct 16 10:30 myfile.txt
```

Breaking this down:

- `-`: File type (- = file, d = directory, l = link)
- `rw-`: Owner permissions (read, write)
- `r--`: Group permissions (read only)
- `r--`: Others permissions (read only)

### Changing Permissions

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh    # rwxr-xr-x
chmod +x script.sh     # Add execute permission
```

## Practical Exercise

Try this hands-on exercise:

```bash
# 1. Check where you are
pwd

# 2. List all files including hidden ones
ls -la

# 3. Navigate to /var/log
cd /var/log

# 4. List log files
ls -lh

# 5. Return home
cd ~

# 6. Create a test directory structure
mkdir -p test/level1/level2
cd test
tree
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the Linux file system, the next steps are:

1. Learn file manipulation (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`)
2. Master text processing tools (`cat`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`)
3. Understand process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)

## Conclusion

The Linux file system might seem intimidating at first, but it's remarkably logical once you understand the structure. Everything has its place, and with these fundamental commands, you can navigate anywhere with confidence.

Keep practicing, and these commands will become second nature! üêß
